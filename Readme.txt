1. Donot run testing.py
	It is used to generate test_data which is already generated for you

2. Please donot delete the empty folders.

3. No input is necessary for running main.py

4. Run main.py 
	It should not take more than few seconds to complete execution
	
	After execution, plot and split_files folders will have some files that
	are generated as part of main.py
	
	plots folder contains individual plots of all unique crime types identified
	(since test data is really small, the plots donot make much sense)
	
	split_files folder contains individual files corresponding to each crime
	(these file are used to plot map in ArcGIS)

5. If you wish to execute the main.py program on entire raw dataset(1.4GB) please
	download the data file from link mentioned in ppt.

6. Thank you
